Hello and welcome to Lab 003 group 1's github repository.
All the code is in the carCode file in different branches. 
The main car driving code is in the doubleDriverCarCode branch. It was recently updated with all the required commenting.
The main sorter code is in the sorterCode branch. It was recently updated with all the required commenting.
The branch car code includes some of the original code used for milestone 2 and is not important anymore.
